# Unit-01-homework-demo

This repository contains an index.html file containing the Horiseon Social Solution Services landing page as well as a style.css file with the associated styling.
It also contains several images used in the HTML file.
Both of these files have been changed to better follow accessibility standards. I have also added comments, and I have cleaned up the CSS where applicable. 
The Horiseon Social Solution Services landing page consists of:
-A header with a title and a navigation bar
-A background image
-A main section with three subsections (each containing text and an image)
-A sidebar with an additional three sections (each with text and an image)
